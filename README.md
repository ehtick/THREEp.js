# THREEp.js

# currently alpha version

THREE.js addon, to produce almost infinite many time-varying Geometries and BufferGeometries with polar / spherical functions

In contrast to THREEf.js, polar / spherical coordinates are used here for the functions.
This results in a different set of properties and functions.

...
_The addon is developed step by step._

_currently only indexed BufferGeometry_
